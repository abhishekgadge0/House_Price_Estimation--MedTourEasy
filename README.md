# House Price Estimation Model

## Introduction
This data science project involves a regression task where I performed data analysis, plotted a graph on Price vs. Condition of houses, built three different regression models, achieved a good RMSE score, and developed a user interface using Streamlit. The project demonstrates the use of data analysis, application of machine learning techniques to solve regression problems, and provides an interactive platform for users to explore the results.

## Project Goals
- Collect data.
- Implement comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Analyze the data and build visualizations to present to stakeholders.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Deploy multiple machine learning models for comparison and evaluation.
- Perform regression analysis to predict target variables.
- Achieve a good RMSE score through model optimization.
- Develop an interactive user interface using Streamlit.

## Methodology
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Analyze, clean, and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and analyze the data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Model Development:** Train, evaluate, and deploy multiple regression models to identify the best performer.
- **User Interface:** Build a Streamlit application to allow users to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features and target variables relevant to the regression task. It underwent thorough cleaning and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis to inform model selection and deployment.
